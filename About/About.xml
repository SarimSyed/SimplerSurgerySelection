    <description>Injuries can be clicked and the available surgeries for that body part will be displayed. I often found myself going back and forth between the operation bill selection dropdown and the injury screen because I didn't want to install a prosthetic or bionic body part to the wrong leg/arm/eye. This should make it easier to treat the part that's actually damaged.</description>
